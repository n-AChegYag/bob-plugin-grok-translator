### ‚ú® Adding Support for Other Language Models

This plugin is designed with extensibility in mind, making it easy to add support for other companies' language models. If you would like to contribute a new translation service provider, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a New Service File**: In the `src/` directory, create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `new_model.js`) following the structure of `grok.js`.
2.  **Implement Translation Logic**: In the new file, implement the logic to interact with the target language model API, including the necessary functions such as `translate`, and follow the Bob plugin API specifications.
3.  **Update `info.json`**: Modify the `info.json` file to add new service configurations or adjust existing ones as needed.
4.  **Update `app.js` (if needed)**: If the new model requires different initialization or processing logic, you may need to modify the `app.js` file.
5.  **Test**: Ensure the new language model integration works properly.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Follow the code contribution process outlined above to submit your changes.

We encourage community members to expand the functionality of this plugin by integrating more excellent translation engines!
